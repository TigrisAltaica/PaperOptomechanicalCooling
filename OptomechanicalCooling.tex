\begin{abstract}
  We model the laser cooling of a parametrically driven optomechanical
  cavity using a dissipation model 
  that accounts for the modification of the quasi-energy spectrum
  caused by the driving. We construct a master equation for the
  mechanical object using Floquet operators. When the natural
  frequency of the mechanical object oscillates periodically around its mean value,
  we derive, using an adiabatic approximation, an analytical
  expression for its temperature. This expression depends both on the
  oscillator's mean frequency and that of the frequency's oscillations
  around its mean value. We find that the temperature can be lower
  than in the non-time dependent case. Our results raise the
  possibility of achieving lower temperatures for the mechanical object
  if its natural frequency can be controlled as a function of time.

\section{Introduction}


Quantum cavity optomechanics studies systems composed of macroscopic
mechanical objects, such as mirrors, and an optical cavity's quantized
light field usually coupled via radiation pressure. In a common scheme
an end-mirror of a Fabry-Perot cavity is suspended while being able to
freely oscillate. When photons are reflected by the mirror, there is a
momentum transfer between the light field and the mirror and hence a
coupling force. As the cavity's resonance depends on its length, the
mechanical displacement affects the light field inside the cavity.
Some of the first theoretical work predicting this sort of coupling is
described in \cite{BraginskiiOG}. This interaction between the
macroscopic mechanical object and the light field leads to several
interesting effects such as optomechanically induced transparency
\cite{WeissOIT}, the optical spring effect \cite{VogelOT} or, most
relevant to this study, optomechanical cooling, which was first proposed by Mancini, et al \cite{CohadonCM,
  CorbittOC, SchliesserRPC, LCNooshi, ManciniOC}.
	
This effect consists of the damping of the end mirror's mechanical
motion due to the radiative coupling to the cavity field. Sideband
cooling takes place when the cavity's resonance is much narrower than
the mechanical frequency. It can be understood as Raman scattering
\cite{MarquardtQTOQ} of incident photons, red-detuned from the cavity
resonance, when the parameters are chosen to favor phonon absorption
from the mechanical oscillator in order to scatter the photon into the
cavity's resonance mode, resulting in cooling. For coherent quantum
control over a mechanical object, it must be close to a pure quantum
mechanical state \cite{KippenberCO} so effective methods of cooling
macroscopic objects to low temperatures is highly desirable.

One possible avenue for improved cooling lies in controlling the
mechanical resonator's frequency as a function of time
\cite{JockelMR}. The effect of this dependence on the mechanical
object's final temperature was studied in \cite{BarberisLC}. In that
study it was found that the final temperature of the parametrically
driven harmonic oscillator was larger than the nondriven case. The
master equation, from which the cooling rates were derived, accounted
for the natural frequency of the mechanical resonator via ad-hoc
time-dependent coefficients that were introduced after performing the
Markov approximation; this approach lead to an incomplete master
equation and thus an incomplete description of the system's dynamics,
as the system is being treated as essentially not time-dependent
during the derivation of the master equation. In this study, we employ
a different method that accounts for the time dependence throughout
the entire derivation.


The formalism which we apply (section \ref{OptmechH}) is based on
Floquet theory and was demonstrated to be a more accurate treatment in
\cite{HanngiFM}. For the case where the drive consist of a small
periodic oscillation with respect to the central frequency of the
mechanical oscillator, the Floquet operators can be given explicitly
(section \ref{SolSmallOsc}). Under the adiabatic approximation, we
derive an approximated expression for the mean phonon occupation
number in the final stages of optomechanical cooling (section
\ref{LasCool}), and compare its prediction to the non-time-dependent
case (section \ref{NumCal}). We find, using the formalism presented
here, that lower temperatures can be obtained if the mechanical object
is parametrically driven. Our results suggest that the theoretical
model of dissipation of the mechanical osscilator can have a
significant influence on the resulting temperature (section
\ref{ConCl}).


% The formalism which we apply is based on Floquet theory and was
% demonstrated to be a more accurate treatment in \cite{HanngiFM}. We
% obtain a master equation expressed in terms of Floquet operators and
% from there derive an approximated expression for the final mechanical
% state's mean phonon occupation number, which is used as a proxy for
% the state's temperature, under the adiabatic approximation. We perform
% numerical calculations in order to compare this expression to the one
% for the non-time-dependent case.

%We study the cooling of a macroscopic mechanical harmonic oscillator
%with time-dependent natural frequency coupled to an optical cavity's
%light field via radiation pressure when the mechanical oscillator's
%natural frequency varies periodically in time with a small amplitude
%vis-a-vis a constant central frequency. Typically \cite{BarberisLC},
%the interaction between the two systems is too small for the cooling
%to be faster than the system's re-thermalization, so a laser, which
%acts as a photon pump, is employed to boost the interaction.

% The paper is structured as follows. In section \ref{OptmechH}, a
% Hamiltonian for optomechanical cooling for the time-dependent harmonic
% oscillator is presented and expressed in terms of time-dependent
% operators and in a displaced reference frame. In section
% \ref{SolSmallOsc}, we calculate explicit expressions  for the specific case of small periodic oscillations. The
% corresponding master equation is obtained in terms of these explicit
% expressions under the Markov approximation. In section
% \ref{LasCool}, we derive a master equation under the adiabatic
% approximation for only the mechanical degrees of freedom and obtain an
% explicit expression of the mean vibrational occupation number as a
% measure of the final state's temperature. Finally, we compare the
% temperature prediction for the non-time dependent case to the new
% prediction obtained in this study.

\section{Optomechanical Hamiltonian}\label{OptmechH}
\subsection{Hamiltonian with Floquet Operators}
	
The standard Hamiltonian for optomechanical cooling \cite{LCNooshi}, in
a reference system that rotates with the same frequency as a laser
that continuously pumps photons into the cavity is

\begin{equation}
H(t) =   H_{\rm cav} + H_{\rm mec}(t) + H_{\rm int} + H_{\rm pump},
\end{equation}

where

\begin{align}
H_{\rm cav} =& -\hbar \delta a^\dagger a,\\
H_{\rm mec}(t) =& \frac{p^2}{2M} + \frac{1}{2}M \nu^2 (t) x^2,\\
H_{\rm int} =& -\hbar g a^\dagger a x,\\
H_{\rm pump} =& \hbar\frac{\Omega}{2}(a^\dagger + a),
\end{align}
$\delta = \omega_{laser} - \omega_{cav}$, in the cavity Hamiltonian, $H_{\rm cav}$, is the frequency difference between the laser and
the cavity; $M$, in the mechanical oscillator Hamiltonian,
$H_{\rm mec}$, is the mechanical oscillator's mass, $p$ its momentum
operator, $x$ its position operator, and $\nu(t)$ its frequency. The
$H_{\rm int}$ term models the interaction between the field and the cavity
mirror where $g$ sets the strength of the coupling \cite{KippenberCO}.
Finally, $H_{\rm pump}$ describes the pumping of the cavity by a field with
a strength proportional to $\Omega$. The mechanical oscillator Hamiltonian has an explicit time dependence given by
$\nu(t)$; in order to employ the Floquet formalism this dependence must be a
periodic function of time.

The Floquet operators are analogous to the usual creation and
annihilation operators for the standard harmonic oscillator and can be
expressed in terms of the mechanical oscillator's position and
momentum operators \cite{HanngiFM}. These operators are

\begin{equation}\label{FloquetOperators}
\Gamma(t) = \frac{1}{2i}\left[\hat{x}\sqrt{\frac{2M}{\hbar}}\dot{f}(t)-\hat{p}\sqrt{\frac{2}{M \hbar }}f(t)\right],
\end{equation} as well as its Hermitian conjugate. $f(t)$ is the solution to the classical time-dependent harmonic oscillator equation of motion in one dimension and is generally a complex function \cite{BrownPT}

\begin{equation} \label{TimeDependentHO}
\ddot{f} + \nu(t)^2f=0.
\end{equation} This equation has two solutions \cite{HanngiFM} of the form
\begin{equation}
f(t) = e^{i\mu t}\phi(t), 
\end{equation}
and its complex conjugate, where $\phi(t)$ is a periodic function of
time with the same period as $\nu(t)$. $\mu$ is, in general, a complex
number \cite{WardFT}. The Floquet operators follow the usual
commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators
\begin{equation}
[\Gamma(t)^\dagger,\Gamma(t)]=1.
\end{equation}

 Using these operators $H_{\rm mec}(t)$ can be written in the same form as the non time-dependent harmonic oscillator with the Floquet operators taking the place of the annihilation operators, with the exception of a global time-dependent scalar coefficient  \cite{BrownPT}

\begin{equation}
H_{\rm mec}(t) = \hbar\frac{W}{|f(t)|^2}\left[\Gamma^\dagger(t)\Gamma(t) + \frac{1}{2}\right],
\end{equation}
with the Wronskian $W$ for \eqref{TimeDependentHO}. The explicit time dependence of the Floquet operators will not be noted from now on for the sake of brevity. Equation
\eqref{FloquetOperators} is then inverted and solved for the harmonic
oscillator's position operator \cite{TesisMaestria}

\begin{equation}
\hat{x} = \frac{b^* \Gamma - b\Gamma^\dagger}{(b^*a-ba^*)}
\end{equation} with

\begin{align}
a =&  \frac{1}{2i}\sqrt{\frac{2M}{\hbar}}\dot{f}\, , \\
b =&  \frac{1}{2i}\sqrt{\frac{2}{M\hbar}}f\, .
\end{align}
These are then substituted back into the interaction Hamiltonian
resulting in

\begin{equation}
H_{\rm int}(t) = g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}a^\dagger a[\gamma_+(t)\Gamma +\gamma_-(t)\Gamma^\dagger],
\end{equation} with coefficients

\begin{align*}
\gamma_+(t)=&\frac{f^*}{(f^*\dot{f}-f\dot{f}^*)},\\
\gamma_-(t)=&\frac{f}{(f\dot{f}^*-f^*\dot{f})}\, .
\end{align*} 


The Hamiltonian contains two separate harmonic oscillator-like terms
that commute with each other, $H_{\rm cav}$ and $H_{\rm mec}$, so the
standard harmonic oscillator master equation structure can be derived
\cite{TesisMaestria}\cite{HanngiFM}. The usual derivation of the
master equation involves a Markov approximation; in previous attempts
to study this type of system, the time dependence of the frequency was
included after the Markov approximation had been performed, via
time-dependent ad-hoc coefficients for the damping \cite{BarberisLC}.
We use the formalism developed in \cite{HanngiFM} to derive the
mechanical dissipation of the optomechanical master equation. Under
this formalism, the frequency's time dependence is accounted for when the
Markov approximation is performed, via the Floquet operators. As
demonstrated in \cite{HanngiFM}, the method employed here is a more
complete, and thus accurate, treatment.

The optomechanical master equation with improved dissipation model is
\begin{equation} \label{LCMasterEquation}
\dot{\rho} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[H,\rho] +L_a\rho + L_\Gamma \rho,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
L_a \rho =& - \frac{\kappa}{2}(n_p + 1)[a^\dagger a\rho + \rho a^\dagger a -2a\rho a^\dagger]  \\
 &- \frac{\kappa}{2}(n_p)[ aa^\dagger\rho + \rho  aa^\dagger -2a^\dagger\rho a]\, ,\nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align}\label{eq:mechanical_dissipation}
  L_\Gamma \rho =& - \frac{\gamma}{2}(n_m + 1)[\Gamma^\dagger \Gamma\rho + \rho \Gamma^\dagger \Gamma -2\Gamma\rho \Gamma^\dagger]  \\
                 &- \frac{\gamma}{2}(n_m)[ \Gamma\Gamma^\dagger\rho + \rho  \Gamma\Gamma^\dagger -2\Gamma^\dagger\rho \Gamma]\, ,\nonumber
\end{align} 
$\kappa$ is the energy decay rate for the cavity and $\gamma$ is the
decay rate for the mechanical oscillator. The number of thermal
excitations for the cavity and the oscillator are given by $n_p$ and
$n_m$ respectively. The superoperators $L_\Gamma$ and $L_a$ model the
energy exchanges between the environment, and the cavity and the
mechanical resonator respectively. Equation \eqref{LCMasterEquation}
is the master equation for a parametrically driven optomechanical
system with an improved dissipation model which accounts for the
mechanical oscillator's time dependent frequency.



\subsection{Displaced Frame}

In order to eliminate the pump term and to find useful approximations
we employ a unitary transformation to shift \eqref{LCMasterEquation}
into a displaced reference frame. This transformation depends on two
time-dependent coefficients, $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$, which are
chosen in a convenient manner to simplify the Hamiltonian. The
transformation is given by the operator
\begin{equation}\label{ShiftTransform}
U_{a,\Gamma} = e^{(\alpha(t) a^\dagger - \alpha^*(t)a)}e^{(\beta(t) \Gamma^\dagger - \beta^*(t)\Gamma)},
\end{equation}
and results in a displaced Hamiltonian and in turn a displaced master
equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:master_no_small}
\dot{\rho}' = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[H',\rho'] +L_a\rho' + L_\Gamma \rho' + C(t)\rho'\, ,
\end{equation}
for the time evolution of the density operator
$\rho'(t)=U\rho U^\dagger$ which represents the coupled
cavity-mechanical resonator system. The primes indicate that the
transformation has been applied. The displaced Hamiltonian, which
includes a pump-like term that appears when making the transformation
on the $L$ operators, is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:hamiltonian_no_small}
  H'=&U H U^\dagger\nonumber\\=& -\hbar \delta' a^\dagger a + \hbar\frac{W}{|f(t)|^2}\Gamma \Gamma^\dagger\nonumber\\
     &-\hbar g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}[(a^{\dagger}a +\alpha a^{\dagger}+\alpha^* a)(\gamma_-(t)\Gamma^{\dagger}+\gamma_+(t)\Gamma)]\nonumber\\
     &+ i\hbar(\beta^*\dot{\Gamma} - \beta \dot{\Gamma}^\dagger),
\end{align}
with $\delta' = \delta + g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}(\beta + \beta^*)$.
This Hamiltonian is valid as long as the coefficients $\alpha(t)$ and
$\beta(t)$ fulfill the differential equations

\begin{align}\label{eq:displaced_frame}
\dot{\alpha} =& \alpha(-\frac{\kappa}{2}+i(\delta+g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}(\gamma_-(t) \beta^* + \gamma_+(t) \beta))-i\frac{\Omega}{2},\\
\dot{\beta} =& \beta(-\frac{\gamma}{2}-i\frac{W}{|f(t)|^2})+ig\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}|\alpha|^2\gamma_+(t).
\end{align}


The $C(t)$ term
 \begin{align}
C(t)\rho = |\beta|^2(C(t)_{+-} - C(t)_{-+})\rho \nonumber,
 \end{align}
 where
\begin{align*}
C(t)_{+-} =& [\dot{\Gamma}^{\dagger}, \Gamma]=\frac{i}{2}(\dot{f}^*
             \dot{f} - \ddot{f}^*f^*)\, ,\\
C(t)_{-+} =& [\dot{\Gamma}, \Gamma^{\dagger}]=\frac{i}{2}(\dot{f}
             \dot{f}^* - \ddot{f}f)\,,
\end{align*}
appears because the Floquet operators do not necessarily commute with
their own time derivatives.

Proceeding further requires an explicit solution for
\eqref{TimeDependentHO}. The primes in the operators will be omitted
from now on as all calculations will be done in the displaced frame.


\section{Solution for Small Oscillations}\label{SolSmallOsc}
 
In order to obtain an explicit form of the Floquet operators we focus
on the case of small oscillations around a central frequency,
specifically

\begin{equation}
\nu(t) = \nu_0 + \epsilon' cos(2\omega t)\, ,
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon' \ll \nu_0$, where $\nu_0$ is the mean frequency. This
leads to the time-dependent harmonic oscillator equation

\begin{equation}\label{SmallOscillationsTDHO}
\ddot{f} + (\nu_0^2 + 2\epsilon' \nu_0 cos(2\omega t))f = 0,
\end{equation}
which is a particular case of the Mathieu equation \cite{PiatekME}.
In order to guarantee stable solutions we use the scattering
relation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\nu_0^2}{\omega^2} = n^2,\label{scattering}
\end{equation}
with $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$\cite{WardFT}. We will focus on the case
$n\gg 1$, which will be used in the next sections. The solutions for
\eqref{SmallOscillationsTDHO} are, to first order in
$\epsilon= \frac{2\epsilon' \nu_0}{\omega^2}$,
\begin{equation}\label{SmallOscillationsSolution}
f(t)=  e^{in\omega t}  + \epsilon \frac{1}{8(n+1)} e^{i(n+2)\omega t} - \epsilon \frac{1}{8(n-1)} e^{i(n-2)\omega t},
\end{equation} and its complex conjugate.


With an explicit solution for \eqref{SmallOscillationsTDHO} in hand,
we can solve Eq.~\eqref{eq:displaced_frame}. Assuming that the time
scales of the dissipative processes are fast compared with the other
time scales we can focus on the stationary case
($\dot{\alpha}(t)=\dot{\beta}(t)=0$); we also assume a weak coupling
regime (coefficients of first order in $g$ or higher are neglected)
obtaining
\begin{align}\label{eq:alpha_beta_sta}
\alpha_0 =& \frac{\Omega}{2\delta-i\kappa},& \beta_0 =& 0.
\end{align}
The 0 sub-index denotes that the solutions are valid only to zeroth
order in the coupling parameter. In obtaining the solution we used
\begin{equation}\label{GammaCoefficients}
\gamma_\pm= \frac{\pm 1}{2i\nu_0}e^{\mp i\nu_0 t},
\end{equation}
and  $\frac{W}{|f|^2} = \nu_0 + \frac{\epsilon \omega}{2n} cos(2\omega t)$. These expressions neglect terms of order $\frac{\epsilon}{n^2}$ and use the approximation $n+1 \approx n-1 \approx n$ since we work in the regime where $n >> 1$. Using \eqref{eq:alpha_beta_sta} in~(\ref{eq:hamiltonian_no_small})
the Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{align}
H =& -\hbar \delta a^{\dagger}a +\hbar(\nu_0 + \frac{\epsilon \omega}{2n} cos(2\omega t))\Gamma^{\dagger}\Gamma \\
&-\hbar g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}(a^{\dagger}a +\alpha_0 a^{\dagger}+\alpha^*_0 a)(\gamma_-(t)\Gamma^{\dagger}+\gamma_+(t)\Gamma)\nonumber.
\end{align}
We focus on the case where $|\alpha_0| \gg 1$
\cite{BarberisLC} so that the $a^\dagger a$ term can be neglected as
it is small when compared to the other two terms in the interaction.
This leads to a further simplified Hamiltonian

\begin{align} \label{LCHamiltonian}
H(t) =& -\hbar \delta a^{\dagger}a +\hbar(\nu_0 + \frac{\epsilon \omega}{2n} cos(2\omega t))\Gamma^{\dagger}\Gamma \\
&+\hbar g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}(\alpha_0 a^{\dagger}+\alpha^*_0 a)(\frac{-e^{i\nu_0 t}}{2i\nu_0}\Gamma-\frac{
e^{i\nu_0 t}}{2i\nu_0} \nonumber\Gamma^{\dagger}).
\end{align}

Finally, using that $C(t)$ is proportional to $\beta_0$, the master
equation~(\ref{eq:master_no_small}) simplifies to
\begin{equation}\label{LCMasterEq}
\dot{\rho} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[H,\rho] +L_a\rho + L_\Gamma \rho = \mathcal{L}\rho.
\end{equation}
This equation looks similar to the standard optomechanical master
equation but it has Floquet operators instead of creation and
annihilation operator for the mechanical oscillator and an explicit
time dependence in the interaction Hamiltonian


\section{Laser Cooling}\label{LasCool}

Our focus is on the parameter regime where the mechanical resonator's
temperature evolves much more slowly than the cavity's losses and than
the inverse of the mechanical frequency. This requires
$(g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}\alpha_o)^2 \ll (\frac{\kappa}{\nu_0})$.
After projecting into the subspace corresponding to the slowly
evolving part of the state and tracing over the cavity degrees of
freedom, we arrive at the following master equation for the density
operator (see Appendix \ref{CoolingAppendix})

\begin{equation}\label{eq:projected_master_equation}
  \dot{\mu}\approx -\frac{g'^2}{2}(G(\nu_m,0)[\Gamma^\dagger_0,\Gamma_0\mu]-G^*(-\nu_m,0)[\Gamma_0^\dagger,\mu\Gamma_0]),
\end{equation}
where we have set $g'=g\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2M}}\alpha_0$,
$\Gamma_0=\gamma_+\Gamma$, $\Gamma_0^\dagger=\gamma_-\Gamma^\dagger$
and use $\mu$ as the density operator of the mechanical degree of
freedom. The cavity-quadratures correlation $G(\nu_m,0)$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{CavityQuadrature}
G(\nu_m,0) = \int_0^\infty dt e^{i\nu(t) t}Tr_a[X_a e^{L_a t} X_a \rho_{st}],
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
X_a = \frac{a + a^\dagger}{\sqrt{2}\alpha_0}.
\end{equation}
and we assumed the cavity is at zero temperature.

The derivation in Appendix \ref{CoolingAppendix} includes a time
integration. However, since the explicit time dependence in the
Floquet Operators takes the form of \eqref{SmallOscillationsSolution}
(and it's time derivative and their complex conjugates), and since
$\nu_0 = n\omega$, this explicit dependence is canceled out by the
coeffcients \eqref{GammaCoefficients}, save for terms that are of the
order $\frac{\epsilon}{n\nu_0}$. Thus, we label these operators as
$\Gamma_0, \Gamma^\dagger_0$ and treat them as non time dependent
operators. \fxnote{Esto no se entiende bien}

The stationary solution of equation
\eqref{eq:projected_master_equation} is known \cite{LCNooshi}.
Defining the cooling and heating rates
\begin{equation}
A_\pm(\nu_m,0) = g'^2{\rm Real}(G(\mp \nu_m,0)),
\end{equation}
where $A_+$ represents heating and $A_-$ represents cooling, the final
number of phonon excitations is given by

\begin{equation}
\langle m \rangle =\langle \Gamma^\dagger \Gamma \rangle = \frac{A_+}{A_- - A_+}.
\end{equation}

In the following section we calculate \eqref{CavityQuadrature} in
order to obtain the heating and cooling rates, and the final
temperature (represented by the average number of phonon excitations)
for an example of a parametrically driven optomechanical system.

\section{Calculation of Mean Vibrational Occupation Number}\label{NumCal}

Assuming that the cavity is at zero temperature ($n_p=0$) the trace
inside \eqref{CavityQuadrature} gives
\begin{equation}
Tr_a[X_a e^{L_a t} X_a \rho_{st}] = \frac{1}{2}e^{-(\frac{\kappa}{2}-i\delta) t},
\end{equation} 
up to first order in $\epsilon$~\eqref{CavityQuadrature} simplifies to
\begin{align}
  G(\nu,0)=&\int_0^\infty dt e^{(i\nu_0 +i\epsilon'\cos{(2\omega t)})t }Tr[...]\nonumber\\
           &\approx\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\infty e^{i (\nu_0+\delta)
             t}e^{-\frac{\kappa t}{2}}dt\nonumber\\
           &+\frac{i\epsilon \omega}{4n}\int_0^\infty cos(2\omega t)t e^{i (\nu_0+\delta)
             t}e^{-\frac{\kappa t}{2}}dt\, ,\nonumber
\end{align}
where the $e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2} t}$ factor acts as a cut-off for the integral, which
allows for the expansion in $\epsilon$ to be performed.See Appendix
\ref{App1} for more on the states used to evaluate the trace and Appendix \ref{TraceAppendix} for a more detailed evaluation of the trace term. This leads
to an expression for \eqref{CavityQuadrature} which consist of two
parts: one corresponding to the nondriven harmonic oscillator case
plus a correction term proportional to $\epsilon$
\begin{equation}
\frac{G(\nu,0)}{g'^2}= \frac{1}{-\kappa + 2i(\delta + \nu_0)} +i\epsilon\frac{\omega}{4n}\frac{(-\kappa + i(\nu_0 + \delta))^2 - 4\omega^2}{((-\kappa + i(\nu_0 + \delta))^2 + 4\omega^2)^2}\, .
\end{equation} %where  $E_0 = g \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\nu_0}}$.

We evaluate the real part of this expression numerically. In order for
the adiabatic approximation to be valid, the variation in the
mechanical oscillator's frequency must be slow when compared to the
frequency itself ($\omega \ll \nu_0$) which translates to classical
solutions with $1 \ll n$ due to \eqref{scattering}. We assume that
$\epsilon' = \frac{\nu_0}{10}$, or, equivalently, $\epsilon = \frac{n^2}{5}$. Physically,
we employ a classical solution which describes a situation where the
oscillator's average $\nu_0$ frequency is the fastest one, while the
secular frequency $\omega$ is the slowest one. In figure \ref{GraficaTemp} it is shown the
number of mechanical oscillations when $\frac{\delta}{\nu_0}$ is in
the range of $[-2,2]$. Compared with the non-driven case, the
parametrically driven oscillator has a frequency shift of where to
expect the minimum number of excitations, and a region where the
predicted number of excitations is smaller. The reason of this
behavior is that, as $\epsilon$ increases, the parametric modulation
causes the cooling and heating coefficients to shift away from each
other, and its distribution becomes narrower and presents a higher
peak. This can be observed in figure \ref{GraficaA-}. As long as
$\nu_0$ and $\omega$ fulfill \eqref{scattering}, altering them does
not change the final temperature. The parameters used are consistent
with the reported controlled frequency modulation
\cite{WoolleyNM}\cite{JockelS}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{ConCl}

Using an improved theoretical description of dissipation of a
parametrically driven mechanical object, in an optomechanical setup,
we found that the lowest temperature reached can be lower than in the
non-driven case. This implies that periodically changing the natural
frequency of the mechanical object in optomechanics can be used for
reaching lower temperatures. This also opens the path for exploring
what happens if the movement of a leaky cavity is taken into
consideration when theoretically treating the dissipation of the
cavity field, because, similarly to the setup study in this paper, the
natural frequency of the cavity field changes periodically with time.
We plan to explore this case in future work.

\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho} = \mathcal{L}_{cav} \rho = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[H,\rho]+L_a\rho, 
\end{equation} with

\begin{align}\label{EMField}
L_a \rho =& - \frac{\kappa}{2}(n_p+1)[a^\dagger a\rho + \rho a^\dagger a -2a\rho a^\dagger] \nonumber \\
 &- \frac{\kappa}{2}(n_p)[ aa^\dagger\rho + \rho  aa^\dagger -2a^\dagger\rho a]\, ,
\end{align}
and
\begin{equation}
  H=\hbar \omega \, a^\dagger a\, ,
\end{equation}
model the behavior of a bosonic field inside a one mode leaky cavity
with frequency $\omega$; the cavity is in contact with a thermal bath
characterized by $n_p$ thermal photons with frequency $\omega$, the
cavity damping is given by $\kappa$ \cite{EnglertDB} and $a^\dagger$,
$a$ are cavity photons creation and anhilation operators. The density
operator can be expressed in a basis given by the Lindblad
superoperator's eigenstates, ${\hat{\rho}_n^l}$,
$n=0,1,2,...\qquad l = 0,\pm 1, \pm 2,... $, where
\begin{equation}
L\hat{\rho}_n^l = \lambda_n^l\hat{\rho}_n^l\label{eq:eigen_damping}\, ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\lambda_n^l = -il\omega -\kappa[n + \frac{|l|}{2}]\, .
\end{equation} The real part of these eigenvalues corresponds only to the $L_a$ term. The full eigenvalues for $\mathcal{L}$  also includes the eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian term, which is the imaginary part.



This basis is known as the damping basis \cite{EnglertDB} and is given by
\begin{align}\label{DefDB}
\hat{\rho}_n^l=&a^{\dagger l}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n_p+1)^{l+1}}:L_n^l[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p+1}]e^{-[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p+1}]}:\quad l \geq 0, \\
\hat{\rho}_n^l=&\frac{(-1)^n}{(n_p+1)^{|l|+1}}:L_n^{|l|}[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p+1}]e^{-[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p+1}]}:a^{|l|}\quad l \leq 0,
\end{align} with eigenvalues

The Lindblad operator is not hermitian and the "left" eigenstates must
be considered to find the coefficients of the density operator
expansion in the damping basis. These are the eigenstates of the
equation $\check{\rho}_n^lL = \lambda_n^l\check{\rho}_n^l$ they have
the same eigenvalues and are given by
\begin{align}\label{DefDBDual}
\check{\rho}_n^l=&(\frac{-n_p}{n_p+1})^n\frac{n!}{(n+l)!}:L_n^l[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p}]:a^{l}\quad l \geq 0, \\
\check{\rho}_n^l=&(\frac{-n_p}{n_p+1})^n\frac{n!}{(n+|l|)!}a^{\dagger|l|}:L_n^{|l|}[\frac{a^\dagger a}{n_p}]:\quad l \leq 0.
\end{align}

The left and right eigenstates are orthogonal under the product
\begin{equation}
Tr[\hat{\rho}_n^l\check{\rho}_{n'}^{l'}] = \delta_{n,n'}\delta_{l,l'},
\end{equation} and fulfill

\begin{equation}\label{DampingBasisCompleteness}
\sum_{\lambda} \hat{\rho}_\lambda \otimes \check{\rho}_\lambda = \mathbb{I},
\end{equation} where the sum is over all possible eigenvalues. An important case is a cavity at zero temperature, in this case the right states are \cite{EnglertDB}

\begin{align}\label{DefDBZero}
\hat{\rho}_n^l=&a^{\dagger l}(-1)^{a^\dagger a + n}\binom{n+l}{a^\dagger a+l} \quad l \geq 0, \\
\hat{\rho}_n^l=&(-1)^{a^\dagger a + n}\binom{n+|l|}{a^\dagger a+|l|}a^{|l|} \quad l < 0,
\end{align} and the left states are

\begin{align}\label{DefDBDualZero}
\check{\rho}_n^l=&\frac{n!}{(n+l)!}\binom{a^\dagger a}{n}a^l \quad l \geq 0, \\
\check{\rho}_n^l=&a^{\dagger|l|}\frac{n!}{(n+|l|)!}\binom{a^\dagger a}{n} \quad l < 0.
\end{align}

These states play an important part in the derivation of the master
equation of the cavity state in the adiabatic approximation.

\section{Laser Cooling and Projection Operators}\label{CoolingAppendix}

In order to find the master equation
\eqref{eq:projected_master_equation} we begin with equation \eqref{LCMasterEq}
\begin{equation}
\dot{\rho}=\mathcal{L}\rho\, ,
\end{equation}
with $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_0+\mathcal{L}_1$,
where
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_0=& \mathcal{L}_{cav} + \mathcal{L}_{mec},\\
 =&(\frac{1}{i\hbar}[H_{\rm cav},\bullet]+L_a) +(\frac{1}{i\hbar}[H_{\rm mec}(t),\bullet]), \nonumber
\end{align}
gives the free dynamics 
and
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_1 = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[H_{\rm int},\bullet],
\end{equation}
gives the field-mechanic oscillator interaction. The mechanical
damping occurs on a slower time scale than the other processes and can
be incorporated after the procedure. We employ projection operators,
like those in \cite{CarmichaelQO}, to separate the evolution in
different time scales and make an adiabatic approximation. The
projection operator $P$ projects the state in a slow-time evolution
space whereas the projection operator $Q$ projects the system in a
fast-time evolution space, they fulfill the completeness relation
\begin{equation}
1 = P + Q,
\end{equation}
and have the properties
\begin{enumerate}

\item $ P\mathcal{L}_{0} = \mathcal{L}_{0}P = 0 $\qquad as the real part of the
  corresponding eigenvalues are 0 

\item $P\mathcal{L}_{1}P=0$ \qquad as the interaction does not couple states in P

\item $P^2 = P \quad Q^2 = Q$ \qquad as $P$ and $Q$ are projectors.
\end{enumerate}
We project the master equation $\dot{\rho}=\mathcal{L}\rho$ into both
$P$ and $Q$ spaces and insert the completeness relation to obtain two
equations. Working in the decay picture

\begin{align*}
 \rho' =& e^{\mathcal{L}_0t}\rho,\\
 \mathcal{L}_1' =& e^{-\mathcal{L}_0t}\mathcal{L}_1e^{\mathcal{L}_0t} = \mathcal{L}_1'.
\end{align*} and omitting primes, the equations are

\begin{align*}
P\dot{\rho} =& P\mathcal{L}_1Q\rho, \\
Q\dot{\rho} =& Q\mathcal{L}Q\rho + Q\mathcal{L}P\rho.
\end{align*} The equation for $Q$ can be formally integrated \cite{TesisMaestria}

\begin{align*}
Q\rho =& Q\rho(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t}dt' Q\mathcal{L}(t')P\rho(t')\\
       &+\int_{t_0}^{t}dt'Q\mathcal{L}(t')Q\rho(t'),\\
\simeq & Q\rho(t_0) + \int_{t_0}^{t}dt' Q\mathcal{L}_1(t')P\rho(t_0)\\
       &+\int_{t_0}^{t}dt'Q\mathcal{L}_1(t')Q\rho(t_0)+O(\eta^2),
\end{align*} and this is substituted into the $P$ equation

\begin{align}
P\dot{\rho}(t) =& P\mathcal{L}_1Q\rho(t_0)\\ 
 &+ P\mathcal{L}_1\int_{t_0}^{t}dt' Q\mathcal{L}_1(t')P\rho(t_0)\nonumber \\
 &+ P\mathcal{L}_1\int_{t_0}^{t}dt'Q\mathcal{L}_1(t')Q\rho(t_0) \nonumber,
\end{align} where only the first integral term is non zero. We focus on this term and transform back from the decay picture

\begin{equation}
P e^{-\mathcal{L}_0 t}\mathcal{L}_1e^{\mathcal{L}_0 t}\int_{t_0}^{t}dt'Qe^{-\mathcal{L}_0 t'}\mathcal{L}_1e^{\mathcal{L}_0 t'}Pe^{-\mathcal{L}_0(t_0)}\rho(t_0).
\end{equation}
We decompose the projectors into the forms
$Q=\sum_\lambda \hat{\rho}_\lambda \otimes \check{\rho}_\lambda$ and
$P=\sum_{\lambda'} \hat{\rho}_{\lambda'} \otimes
\check{\rho}_{\lambda'}$.

These projectors are a tensor product of both cavity and mechanical
oscillator states. More explicitly
\begin{equation}
P = \sum_{\lambda'} (\hat{\rho}_{\lambda'}^{cav}\otimes\hat{\rho}_{\lambda'}^{mec})\otimes(\check{\rho}_{\lambda'}^{cav}\otimes\check{\rho}_{\lambda'}^{mec}),
\end{equation} where the cavity states are those of Appendix \ref{App1} and the mechanical states are simply the eigenstates of $\mathcal{L}_{mec}$

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\lambda_l}^{mec}=\Ket{n}\Bra{n+l},
\end{equation} with eigenvalues

\begin{equation}
\lambda_l = -i l \nu(t).
\end{equation}
The $Q$ projector is completely analogous. What defines the sub-spaces
$P$ and $Q$ are the time scales associated with each space. The
eigenvalues of the states are given by $\lambda, \lambda'$. $\lambda$
corresponds to the fast time scale, which is equivalent to eigenvalues
with a non-zero real part, as those states decay quickly. $\lambda'$
states correspond to the slow time scale as their eigenvalues are
imaginary and thus these states do not decay. With these explicit
expressions on hand we may evaluate the $\mathcal{L}_0$ terms directly
by applying them to the nearest states

\begin{align}\label{ProyectionEQ}
P e^{-\mathcal{L}_0 t}\mathcal{L}_1[&\sum_{\lambda',\lambda}\int_{t_0}^{t}dt'e^{\lambda t} \hat{\rho}_{\lambda} \otimes \check{\rho}_{\lambda}e^{-\lambda t'}\mathcal{L}_1\\
&e^{\lambda' t'}\hat{\rho}_{\lambda'} \otimes \check{\rho}_{\lambda'} e^{-\lambda' t_0}\rho(t_0)]\nonumber.
\end{align} We focus only on the exponential terms, which are now numbers and can be shifted accordingly

\begin{equation}\label{LambdaExponentials}
[\int_{t_0}^t dt' e^{(\lambda'-\lambda)t'}]e^{\lambda t- \lambda't_0}.
\end{equation}
Here we note that $\lambda' = \lambda_{mec}(t)$ as the cavity is taken
to be at zero temperature. Since
$\lambda_{mec}(t) = i\nu_0 + i\epsilon' \cos(2\omega t)$ we must take
care during the integration. Here we make an important note. In
general, the $\Gamma$ operators contained within the $\mathcal{L}_1$
term are explicitly time dependent. However, in this particular case,
due to the form of \eqref{SmallOscillationsSolution}, when multiplied
by \eqref{GammaCoefficients}, the explicit time dependence is canceled
out excluding terms of order $\frac{\epsilon}{n\nu_0}$ and so we
consider them to be non time-dependent and do not account for them
during the integration. To perform the integration we employ the
approximation

\begin{equation}
e^{(\lambda'-\lambda)t'} \approx e^{(i\nu_0-\lambda)t'} + i\epsilon' \cos(2 \omega t')t' e^{(i\nu_0-\lambda)t'}.
\end{equation} Each terms is then integrated separately. For the first term, this results in

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{i\nu_0-\lambda}[e^{(i\nu_0-\lambda)t}-e^{(i\nu_0-\lambda)t_0}]e^{\lambda t - \lambda' t_0}.
\end{equation} Remembering that in this case $\lambda' = i\nu_0 + i \epsilon' \cos(2\omega t)$ this is equivalent to

\begin{equation}\label{FirstTermLambdaExponentials}
\frac{1}{i\nu_0-\lambda}[e^{\lambda'(t-t_0)}e^{\epsilon' \cos(2\omega t_0)t_0} -e^{\lambda'(t-t_0)}e^{\lambda(t-t_0)}e^{\epsilon' \cos(2\omega t_0)t_0}].
\end{equation} The adiabatic approximation consists of taking the limit $(t-t_0) \to \infty$ or $t \to \infty, \quad t_0 \to 0$. In this limit

\begin{equation}
e^{\lambda t} \to 0 \qquad e^{\lambda' t} \to 1.
\end{equation} This is due to $\lambda$ representing the fast time scale which decays quickly, while $\lambda'$ represents the slow time scale which contains stationary states. Under these conditions, \eqref{FirstTermLambdaExponentials} is equal to simply

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{a},
\end{equation}  with $a = i\nu_0 - \lambda$. The procedure for the second term is completely analogous, and so, up to first order in $\epsilon'$ and under the adiabatic approximation, \eqref{LambdaExponentials} is equal to

\begin{equation}
[\int_{t_0}^t dt' e^{(\lambda'-\lambda)t'}]e^{\lambda t- \lambda't_0} = \frac{1}{a} + i\epsilon' \frac{a^2 - \omega^2}{(4\omega^2 + a^2)^2} = I_{\lambda',\lambda}.
\end{equation} Returning to \eqref{ProyectionEQ}, we may now write it as

\begin{equation}
Pe^{-\mathcal{L}_0 t} \sum_{\lambda',\lambda} \mathcal{L}_1 I_{\lambda',\lambda} \rho_{\lambda'} \mathcal{L}_1 \rho_\lambda \rho(t_0).
\end{equation} We may return the projectors to their original notation to remove the sums over $\lambda$.  Now, the sums are over the possible values of the mechanical eigenvalues 

\begin{equation}
Pe^{-\mathcal{L}_0 t} \sum_{m} \mathcal{L}_1 I_{m} Q \mathcal{L}_1 P \rho(t_0).
\end{equation} We return to the full equation, which is multiplied by $Pe^{\mathcal{L}_0 t}$ 

\begin{equation}
P\dot{\rho} = P[\mathcal{L}_0]P \rho(t) + \sum_{m} P \mathcal{L}_1 I_{m} Q \mathcal{L}_1 P \rho(t_0).
\end{equation} We then trace over all the cavity degrees of freedom and set  $\mu = Tr_c[P\rho]\otimes \rho_{st}$, where we assume no correlation between the cavity and mirror states at time $t_0$. This leads to the equation

\begin{equation}\label{FinalProyectedEq}
\dot{\mu}_m = \mathcal{L}_{mec}\mu_m + Tr_c[ \mathcal{L}_1 I_m \mathcal{L}_1  \mu_m],
\end{equation} for any given value of $m$. Remembering that $\mathcal{L}_1 = \frac{1}{i\hbar}[X_a X_\Gamma,\bullet]$ and that the mechanical operators $\Gamma$ may leave the trace alongside $\mu$, equation \eqref{FinalProyectedEq} can be written as \eqref{eq:projected_master_equation}. The coefficients $G(\nu_m,0)$ can be written as

\begin{equation}\label{GAppendix}
G(\nu_m,0)=\int_0^\infty dt' e^{\i\nu(t')t'}Tr_c[X_a e^{L_a t'} X_a \rho_st], 
\end{equation} for convenience.




\subsection{Evaluation of Trace Term}\label{TraceAppendix}

In order to calculate the $G(\nu_m,0)$ terms in \eqref{eq:projected_master_equation}, the term

\begin{equation}\label{CoolingTrace}
T=Tr_a[X_ae^{L_at}X_a\rho_{st}],
\end{equation} must be calculated explicitly. The calculation hinges on the damping basis states detailed in Appendix \ref{App1}. The cavity's stationary state is taken to be the zero temperature base state.

\begin{equation}
\rho_{st} = \Ket{0}\Bra{0},
\end{equation} and we recall that

\begin{equation}
X_a = \frac{(\alpha_0a^{\dagger}+\alpha_0^*a)}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation} The first step is to separate the term \eqref{CoolingTrace} using \eqref{DampingBasisCompleteness}

\begin{equation}
Tr_c[X_ae^{L_at}X_a\rho_st] = \sum_\lambda Tr_c[X_ae^{L_at}\hat{\rho}_\lambda] \otimes Tr_c[\check{\rho}_\lambda X_a\Ket{0}\Bra{0}].
\end{equation} In this context $\lambda$ refers exclusively to the cavity eigenvalues. The $a$ term of $X_a$ is zero when applied to $\rho_{st}$ and so 

\begin{align}
T=& \alpha_0\sum_\lambda Tr_c[X_ae^{L_at}\hat{\rho}_\lambda] \otimes Tr_c[\check{\rho}_\lambda\Ket{1}\Bra{0}],\\
=&\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_\lambda Tr_c[X_ae^{L_at}\hat{\rho}_\lambda] \delta_{n,0}\delta_{l,-1},\\
=&\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{2}} Tr_c[X_ae^{L_at}\hat{\rho}_0^{-1}],\\
=&\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{2}}e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}} Tr_c[X_a\hat{\rho}_0^{-1}],\\
=&\frac{\alpha_0}{2}e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}}\alpha_0^*Tr_c[\Ket{0}\Bra{0}],\\
=&\frac{|\alpha_0|^2}{2}e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}}.
\end{align} Here we used the fact that $F\hat{\rho}_0^{-1}=\Ket{0}\Bra{0}$.
